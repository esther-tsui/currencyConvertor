You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries:

Colombian Pesos
Brazilian Reais
Peruvian Soles


Write a Swift program that converts the amount of each foreign currency and displays the total amount in USD.
